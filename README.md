# datafest-project
The main code for the project created by my team for Emory's Datafest 2019. We won the Best Visualization Award.

The powerpoint presentation we used to present our analysis to the judges is included.

The file "datafestTreeVisualizationPerPlayer.py" contains the code for the decision trees, and
the file "wellnessCopy" contains the data that was analyzed. Basically, a decision tree was created
for each player to show which feautres could be used to predict whether or not they would be
fatigued. The feature importances were also printed so that we could see which of the features were
most important for determining a specific player's fatigue.
